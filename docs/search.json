This is to be done in the laundry room when you pick up/drop off your walkie. There is a Quick Clock on the app that can be used without having to sign in, otherwise, once you sign in you will click on either Start Work, or End Work. If you miss punching in or out, there are exception forms that can be filled out with the missed time. These are in the Laundry Room on the whiteboard. Fill out the form and put it in Suzanne’s mailbox before the end of the pay period. Pay periods are the 1st-15th, and the 15th-Last day. You will get paid on the 15th and the Last day of the month.\n\n\n\nAll information in Daxko is always confidential.\nDaxko and membership information should only be given to adults (18+) that are listed on the unit. * There are some situations where it might seem ok to give out personal information to someone, but please remember that giving personal info to anyone that is not listed on the unit, and over 18, is not approved.\nDaxko information in a membership, especially billing and scholarship information, should never be given to minors. Occasionally a minor will come in to use the Y, and the membership in not currently active. In this case, do no give out billing info or scholarship info to the minor.

There are signs up front to help direct members.\nMember Services staff should still pay attention to everyone coming in the building, and should be where most people are checking in. The self-check in station is a tool to help with the busy times when there is not double coverage up at the front. This is not an excuse to not pay attention, you should still be greeting everyone when they come in.\nMember Services should monitor the self-check in station to make sure those checking in are active.\nRegarding rosters: You can use the “Who is Here?” list to see who is in the building to compare to the roster. You can call a MOD up to help monitor when you know a class is starting if that is helpful.\n\n\n\nIf someone calls and requests a tour, let them know they can come in anytime for a tour, or if they want to set up a time they can do that as well.

There is a Quick Clock on the app that can be used without having to sign in, otherwise, once you sign in you will click on either Start Work, or End Work. If you miss punching in or out, there are exception forms that can be filled out with the missed time. These are in the Laundry Room on the whiteboard. Fill out the form and put it in Suzanne’s mailbox before the end of the pay period. Pay periods are the 1st-15th, and the 15th-Last day. You will get paid on the 15th and the Last day of the month."
